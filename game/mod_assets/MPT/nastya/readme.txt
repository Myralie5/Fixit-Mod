Personality: She is milancholic and prone to stressful situations and depression, but she tries not to show it in public and pretends to be "calm and all right", but is not always the case, which can be noted when her hands shake during stressful situations or is under the influence of others. Most often, she can not refuse someone in any request, even if it would be to the detriment of themselves. It is very difficult for Nastya to admit that she cannot do what is placed on her shoulders, so she tries with all her might to at least pretend that she is doing her job. She likes to communicate with people, but it's much easier for her to do it on the Internet than in real life. You can often see messages from her on any social network, for example in Rine (invented) - analog of Line messenger, which is popular in Japan in IRL. She also likes physical intimacy, such as being hugged or stroked by her hair. Sometimes she may give or say something cringe or shitpost. She can occasionally be very vulgar and blunt as well, and may bring up sensitive topics in conversation

Hobbies: She likes to play acoustic guitar and wants to try playing electric guitar someday, despite her melancholic nature she likes listening to music such as rock and punk rock, besides music she studies programming she understands that it is difficult for her, but she does not want to quit because even if she does not understand it, she likes to do it, besides music and programming she likes to read some books or watch TV series, anime or movies. 


Likes: listening to music (she'll sometimes just put on her headphones in class and listen to music while ignoring everything around her), reading, playing the guitar, and cooking.
She'll watch anything that catches her interests and enjoys drawing, even if she's not very good at it. Loves sweets.
Favorite bands are: "king of jesters" (invented) - Based on real band "King and Jester" and twenty two pilots (invented)
Dislikes: does not like modern music and prefers music that was written in the 90s or in the 2000s. She does not like children because of their constant yelling and inadequate behavior.


background: Her background I leave completely to you, but please take into account only one detail; namely that her father is from Russia and that her mother is from Japan, which explains her name

Sidnotes:
If you need new poses, faces, outfits, etc, I can give you the artist's contacts (but note that he is from Russia, and you may have problems with communication).

I am not an artist, but I am an OÐ¡ author, the original artist has a nickname - Spirtowochka, you can leave in credits both me and him, but best of all both.

I don't want to put any limits on you, so I'll let you change whatever you want, but I'll be happy if you stick to my concept of her personality
